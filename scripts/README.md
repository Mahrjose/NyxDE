### fetch-weather.sh

**Purpose**:  
`fetch-weather.sh` is a script designed to fetch and display the current weather for a specified location. It interacts with the `wttr.in` service to retrieve both simple and detailed weather information, which is then formatted and output as a JSON string.

**Features**:
- Fetches basic weather data (e.g., temperature, condition) as well as detailed information (e.g., wind, precipitation).
- Cleans up the data for better readability, including removing unwanted symbols and formatting the location.
- Attempts to fetch the weather up to 5 times in case of failure, ensuring reliability.

**Usage**:
```bash
./fetch-weather.sh "New+York"
```

**Example Output**:
```json
{"text":"‚òÅÔ∏è 25¬∞C", "tooltip":"New York: üåßÔ∏è Light rain, 25¬∞C"}
```

### globalcontrol.sh

**Purpose**:  
`globalcontrol.sh` is the heart of the **NyxDE** configuration management. It handles various tasks such as generating wallpaper hashes, managing theme lists, and updating configuration files.

**Features**:
- **generateWallpaperHash**: Scans directories for image files, generating hashes and paths, which are stored in arrays. Supports verbose output and the option to skip directories with no images.
- **setWallpaperHash**: Calculates the hash of a specified wallpaper using a chosen hash algorithm.
- **generateThemeList**: Creates a sorted list of themes, ensuring correct symlinks for wallpapers and collecting theme data into arrays.
- **updateConfig**: Updates or adds key-value pairs in the **NyxDE** configuration file.
- **isPackageInstalled**: Checks if a package is installed on the system via Pacman, Flatpak, or if its command is available.
- **findAurHelper**: Identifies the AUR helper (like `paru` or `yay`) installed on the system.

**Usage**:
- **Generate Wallpaper Hashes**:
  ```bash
  ./globalcontrol.sh generateWallpaperHash ~/Pictures/Wallpapers --verbose
  ```
- **Generate Theme List**:
  ```bash
  ./globalcontrol.sh generateThemeList --verbose
  ```

**Notes**:
- This script relies on environment variables for configuration directories, theme settings, and more. Ensure that these are correctly set before running the script.
